            <h3>About Surfing</h3>
              <p>In 2010, I picked up a surfboard for the very first time, and it changed my life. I fell in love with the sport the second I caught my first wave. From then on, I dedicated all of my free time to learning to get better, through land training, youtube videos, coaching, and more. I was in the ocean for 2 hours a day at least 3 times a week, and in the summer it was all day, everday. When you ride down a wave, pure dopamine floods your veins, which leads to a euphoric experience that I will never forget.</p>

            <h3>Competitions</h3>
              <p>When I got to high school, I started competing for the RFH Surf Team. Competitions occur in a bracket-like format. 5 surfers enter the water for a given period of time, usually around 15 minutes. The surfers each try to catch as many waves as they can, and each one is scored by a group of judges. The scoring is based off a number of aspects such as the tricks you do, your style, the size of the wave, and the duration of your ride. After your "heat" ends, the judges take the average of each surfer's two best waves to determine the placement results. Either the top 3 or the winner of the heat moves on to the next round, and the pattern continues until there is a final heat. My team competed in 1v1 competitions against other schools, as well as the state competition once a year. Out of the high school team, I also competed in the Eastern Surfing Association (ESA) competitions year round.<p>

              <h4>Sponsorships</h4>
                <p>Many surfing, apparel, and extreme sport brands support surfers as sponsors. These sponsors provide gear, recognition, and stability to the atheletes they choose. In return, the surfer must wear their brand, support them through social media, and put their logo on their surfboards. I personally have two small sponsorships through surfing. In return for representing their brand at competitions and on instagram, they send me free clothing and surfing gear. Since these sponsorships are small, I do not get a lot of stuff, but it is still nice to have them supporting me.</p>

            <h3>Instructing</h3>
              <p>Throughout the summers of 2017 and 2018, I worked as a surfing instructor at a small surf school named "Pigdog Surf Academy". The owner of the school reached out to me before my first summer offering me a job. He was my 7th grade Social Studies teacher, and he remembered that I was a surfer. I had a lot of fun working with him and the other instructors over those two summers. It wasn't too dificult, but we did have to tread water for 4 hours a day and push kids into waves. This was my first experience teaching kids something that I knew a lot about, and because of it I discovered that I have a passion for teaching. The kids also loved how passionate I was about the sport, and they always wanted to watch me surf, because the skill gab between them and I was intense. I would love to keep teaching surfing, but my company was bought out by a bigger school, which I had denied employment from to work for my 7th grade teacher. Unfortunately, they wont take me anymore, but I have since moved on to other forms of teaching.</p>
