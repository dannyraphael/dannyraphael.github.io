            <h3>About Sailing</h3>
              <p>Sailing is one of the simple pleasures of life. With nothing but a sail and some lines, one can cruise around and experience the quite beauty of the open water. I learned to sail by my father when I was about 6. At age 8, I started sailing without him, in a type of boat called an Optimist, or Opti. Sailing is a skill that I will keep for the rest of my life, and intend to practice it until the day I die. There is nothing more calming than sailing, to me.</p>

            <h3>Regattas</h3>
              <p>When it comes to racing, sailing is one of the most competitive sports in the world. I started racing when I was 8, and stopped when I was 18. I raced in Opti's until I was 15, where I switched to 420's and FJ's. These are two hand (two person) boats that are commonly raced in high school and college. There are many different factors that make up a good racer. The skills required include...</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Knowing the "right of way" rules</li>
                <li>Arguing the rules</li>
                <li>Understanding how current moves</li>
                <li>Reading the wind movement</li>
                <li>Having good boat speed</li>
                <li>Performing under extreme stress and pressure</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The objective of the race is to round a series of precicely shaped boueys, or marks, as fast as possible. Throughout my life, I raced Opti's in elementary and middle school, and then 420's and FJ's in high school.</p>

            <h3>Instructing</h3>
              <p>In addition to racing, I also instruct sailing in a junior sailing program for ages 8-14. I am the head instructor, as well as the racing coach. The program teaches beginner, intermediate, and advanced tactics. Along with these three levels, there is also a race team for those interested in taking their sailing skills to the next level. The summer of 2021 will be my 3rd season working for the Fair Haven Sailing Club, and my second year as head instructor. I find great satisfaction in teaching children to sail. It is incredibly rewarding when things click to them, and they never hesitate to tell you that it was because of you. I hope to develop a side career of teaching kids and adults to sail later on in my life.</p>
