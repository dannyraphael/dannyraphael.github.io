            <h3>About Pole Vaulting</h3>
              <p>While unmistakably physically demanding, Pole Vaulting is the most mentally imperative sport I have ever learned. I competed in sprinting events of Track and Field since my freshman year, but switched to pole vaulting my junior year to escape the horrors of sprinting practice. I didn't know how important the event would become to me. As it turns out, I was anatural at it, and improved at an accelerating rate compared to the average vaulter. When you are running full speed at the pole vault pit, the first thing your brain tells you to do is "be safe". Adrenaline gets pumped through your body, which subconsciously prevents you from doing anything that may lead to injury. However, every motion of pole vaulting is the exact opposite of what would ensure safety. There are hundreds of little things to think of in the one second that you are airborn, refering to the fact that you must apply force and pressure in different directions at specific times to every part of your body. It shouldn't make sense that you have to push your hands upwards in order to bend the pole, or that if you pull up on the pole you WILL NOT go higher, but it happens that way. The most important thing in pole vaulting is that you ignore the muscle memory and the adrenaline, so that you can make your body move exactly how you want it to. In that way, it is incredibly similar to gymnastics.</p>

            <h3>Meets</h3>
              <p>Pole vault competitions are unique and wildly entertaining to watch. The way the oporate is the bar that you must clear is first set at a low height, which varies depending on the meet. Each contestant has three chances to clear the height. If they do, they move on to the next height, and if they don't, they are out. When everyone is either cleared or out, the bar gets moved up 6 inches. This repeats until there is one person left, in which they can then move the bar to whichever height they want. This is for the purpose of setting records. When I joined the RFH Pole Vault team, I quickly became one of the top jumpers. The only kid better than me took me under his wing, and I can credit a lot of my success to him. I competed for 3 1/2 seasons as a pole vaulter; i sprained my wrist durring the first meet of winter track my senior year and was out for the season. However, when I returned in the spring, I won every meet up until the state qualifier, where I tragically knocked the bar down even though I shot a foot over it.</p>

                <p>When I broke the school pole vaulting record, the former record holder was watching. He is the son of my coach, and is two years older than I am. I beat his record by 1 inch, and he couldn't have been more proud. I worked all season to acomplish it, and so many times I got close but couldn't get it quite right, but that one time it all came together, I finally got it! Along with the former record holder, my closest friends, girlfriend and her family, teammates, parents, and coaches were all there to support me as well. I couldn't have asked for a better crowd to witness me accomplish my goal.</p>

            <h3>Coaching</h3>
              <p>Now, whenever I am home, I go back to my high school and I help my former coach train the new vaulters. I love coaching the sport, because it is all about communication. I try to find new ways to get the kids to understand a feeling with only my words. It can be agrivating, but when you find the right metaphor or word sequence that gets through to someone, it is incredibly rewarding. You can see it in their eyes after they take a jump and fix a mistake, they realize it right there and then. That is why I love to coach. To show people something new, something they have never experienced before, and watch them learn. I hope that someone can break my record. I hope that I can help them do it, and I hope I am there to experience it, just as the former record holder was for me.</p>
