    <h1>Daniel Raphael</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my very first web page? Before this, I had absolutely no idea how to write or read code. I now know enough to do exactly this, and I cannot wait to learn how to do more with it. I want to learn code because my sister, who works in communications in New York, couldn't stress enough how important it is for the future, and how valuble the skill will be. In the mean time, here's some stuff about me!😃</p>
