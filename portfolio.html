            <h3>About Me</h3>
              <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Raphael. I am a 20 year old sophomore at the University of Miami in Coral Gables. This website is a virtual portfolio of my athletic achievments before, during, and beyond high school. While I also played other sports, Sailing, Surfing, and Pole Vaulting were not only my favorites, but the ones I excelled at the most. I grew up in a small town in New Jersey named Fair Haven, and I graduated from Rumson-Fair Haven Regional High School. Located between two rivers and the Atlantic Ocean, my hometown's geography provided me with easy access to water sports, and I couldn't have asked for more. To this day, I countinue to surf and sail when I am in New Jersey. My two sisters, Stephanie and Carolyn, are 10-12 years older than me, and left for college when I was about 7, so it was just my parents and I at home. This lead to my love for individual sports, as I apreciate a quieter approach to competition. Throughout my portfolio, you will learn the basic principals of the three sports, view my personal statistics and accomplishments, and see pictures and videos of me playing the sports. Please enjoy!
